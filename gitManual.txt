Step 1:

$
git init
git status
git add .
git status
git config --global user.name ""
git config --global user.email ""
git commit -m "Comment"
git log
$


Step 2: To authorize our system with a GitHub account.


GitHub: Settings-->SSH and GPG keys

Command 1: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Command 2: eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

Command 3: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Command 4: clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Your SSH key is already copied to the clipboard, now go to the GitHub website and click on the “New SSH key” button.

Paste the copied SSH key in the Key field and give any title.

Then click on the “Add SSH key” button; after this, it will ask you to confirm your GitHub password.



Step 3: Creating a repository 



Step 4: pull our local Git repository on GitHub


Command 1: git remote add origin git@github.com:MrigankaB/Git-manual.git 

Adds the remote repositary

Command 2: git push -u origin master

Push all the content of your local repository to the remote repository.

Command 3: git pull -u origin master

Pull our remote repository



***************************************************


Scanning Changes To Files Using git diff command (Before Commit)

Before staging: git diff file_name

After staging:  git diff -staged filename 

Revert to old changes : git reset filename -----> git checkout filename


***************************************************


Stage changes on our local repository.

“git add -A” stages All the files present in the directory.


“git add .” stages new and modified, without deleted. It means this command will put all the new and modified files in the staging area,
 excluding the deleted files.

“git add -u” stages modified and deleted, without new. It means this command will put all the modified and deleted files in the 
staging area, excluding the new files.



*****************************************


git init - This command makes the directory a Git repository.

git status - This command is used to check the status of our repository.

git --version - This command is used to check the version of the Git installed on our system.


git add . - This command adds all the files of a repository to the staging area.

git commit -m “message” - This command is used to commit all the changes. It creates a “save point,” i.e., we can revert to the 
old savepoint when needed.


git log - This command is used to view the history of commits for a repository.


git config --global user.name “Name” - This command is used to configure or set the user name.

git config --global user.email “email id” - This command is used to set email.



*********************************


Working Directory: This is the directory that we’ve initialized, and here all the changes are being made for committing on GitHub.


Staging Area: This is where we first put our code or files of the working repository. The command that we use to stage code is, “git add .”,
“git add FileName” or “git add -all”. 
In simple terms, staging means telling Git what files we want to commit (new untracked files, modified files, or deleted files).


Git directory (repository): This is where all the commits are stored whenever we make a commit. We can revert to an older version of our project 
using the “git checkout” command from this directory. 


*********************************

Example:

Suppose there are three people in a team named “Harry,” “Rohan,” and “Aakash.” Let’s assume they are working on some project called the “Flask app”. 
Now, Harry made a pull request to fetch the project’s content on his system, and then he made some changes in the code base, and then he pushed the 
changes to Git. 

After that, Rohan and Aakash also did the same thing. So, now, if there’s any bug in the code, we can easily rectify it by reverting to the more 
stable version. 

This means that Git facilitates us to toggle between the different commits made by team members.

Note: You should always put relevant messages while committing changes in the repository. This will help other developers to understand what changes 
you made in that particular commit.


**********************************

Branches:

Branches in Git are very similar to branches of a tree, i.e., you can put a unique set of code in a branch and can manipulate it, and there will be no effect
on the actual or master branch.

Step 1: Open the local repository, then open Git bash.

Step 2: Now perform these commands,

        git branch branch_name - This command will create a new branch with the specified name.

        git branch - This command will show all the available branches present in the repository.
          
        git checkout branch_name - This command will switch the master branch to the specified 
                                   branch name or vice versa

	
After making all the changes, you’ve to put the changes into the staging area, and then you can commit them.
Now you can even push these changes to the remote repository, for that perform this command.

Now you want to merge it with the master branch, then, first of all, you’ve to switch to master branch, then 
you’ve to execute this command,

                             git merge branch_name 

Now you can push this to a remote repository
